- oops, im_lineset() needs to ask for WIO of mask and ink
- move cache invalidation to REGION, fixes a race
- don't im_invalidate() after paint, it can cause horrible performance

- argh, missing init from colour.c (thanks Peter)
- argh, im_measure() was not looping over bands correctly (thanks Peter)
- removed mmap_limit, we now always use windows ... reduces VM use hugely,
  because mmap windows are freed when their regions are freed, while images
  are only unmapped when they are closed
- have a min bytes for mmap windows as well, so we don't make too many tiny
  windows
- im_disp2Lab() was broken

  (thank you Ole)
- started gtk-doc changes
- renamed im_meta_get_type() and im_header_get_type() as
  im_meta_get_typeof() and im_header_get_typeof() to prevent confusion with
  GObject type definers (was breaking gtkdoc object scan)
- revised more names, limited documented API
- im_buildlut() could segv for non-zero based tables (thanks Jack)
- VIPS_BUF_STATIC() does not take length arg

  im_multiply(), im_divide(), im_remainder()
- im_remainder() has a float result for float types
- im_measure() allows sel == NULL, meaning all patches
- added "deprecated" package
- faster, simpler, better im_max(), im_min, im_avg(), im_deviate()
- im_max() returns true modulus, not square of modulus, for complex images
- im_avg() works for complex, returning average modulus
- im_system() fix (thanks Roland)
- im_system() rewrite
- im_maxpos()/im_minpos() are partial and work for complex
- im_max()/im_min() are now convenience functions
- im_maxpos_avg() handles complex and multi-band images
- added im_point(), rewrite im_point_bilinear() in terms of this
- close callbacks now happen *after* images have closed resources (such as
  open files) ... this lets them delete temps and stuff. Expect breakage :(

- boolean revised: smaller, more general, faster
- im_remainderconst_vec() renamed to im_remainder_vec() for consistency
- added im_shift*_vec()
- renamed im_eor_vec() as im_eorimage_vec() for consistency, also and, or

- fix up addr calcs on 64-bit machines with >2gb images and inplace ops
  (thanks Christoph)

- im_jpeg2vips.c, set scale_num on shrink (thanks Guido)
- heh argh reading history always stopped after the first line (thanks Haida)
- added im_histindexed
- new im_iterate() calls start and stop functions from workers so resources
  they make are owned by the worker thread ... this makes it possible to have
  start functions which create mutiple regions and therefore allows
  im_iterate() to scan more than one image at once
- threadgroup no longer has any default action, you must attach a work
  function
- added im_copy_file()
- added im_insertset()
- im_insertplace() allows small to be outside big
- added im__colour_difference(), colour ops now work on any image format
- added im_col_display_get_table(), so display tables are now shared by name
- added im__colour_unary()
- drop "set" postfix from names, so "insert" can now take a vector of positions
- deprecate all the "_raw" variants, not really necessary now
- removed "contrib", not very useful anymore
- added im_header_as_string()
- im_malloc()/im_free() now call g_try_malloc()/g_free() ... removes confusion
  over whether to use im_free() or g_free() for things like im_header_string()

  so you no longer need the "header" program

  im_prepare_inplace() to im_prepare_to()

  benchmark:

  - system

	hardware: 2 x 2.5GHz P4, 1GB RAM, 15k SCSI, ReiserFS
	os: suse 8 (kernel 2.4.18)
	compiler: gcc 2.95.3, -O2, threads turned on
	images: fred.v, fred2.v; both 4k by 4k LABPACK (64MB)
	images: jim.v, jim2.v; both 15k by 15k LABPACK (900MB)
	time: smallest real of 5 runs, system idle
	vips: 7.7.23, debug on in im_openin.c, window limit set with an
	  environment variable

  - benchmarks

	cpu-bound: im_sharpen fred.v fred3.v 11 1.5 20 50 1 2
	io-bound: im_insert fred.v fred2.v fred3.v 4000 0
	worst-case: im_rot90 fred.v fred3.v

  - results

	desktop:

			no mmap windows		mmap windows

	cpu-bound	real    0m3.712s	real    0m3.970s
			user    0m6.010s	user    0m6.390s
			sys     0m0.900s 	sys     0m1.110s

	io-bound	real    0m1.813s	real    0m1.865s
			user    0m0.900s	user    0m0.990s
			sys     0m1.720s 	sys     0m1.520s

	worst-case	real    0m1.344s	real    0m3.039s
			user    0m1.270s	user    0m2.230s
			sys     0m0.850s	sys     0m3.050s

  not quite sure why sharpen is a little slower (4%?) ... IO speed is about
  the same though ... worst-case is having to constantly move windows about
  (500,000 page faults, vs 10,000 for no windows)

  again, with an image larger than RAM

  			no mmap windows		mmap windows

	io-bound 	real    2m52.759s	real    2m11.172s
			user    0m14.940s	user    0m14.890s
			sys     0m29.940s	sys     0m26.560s

	worst-case	real    3m35.391s	real    3m50.760s
			user    0m19.850s	user    0m26.600s
			sys     0m12.650s 	sys     0m43.130s

  mmap windows actually slightly faster in this case ... plus they stress the
  OS less

  only user-visible change is that all plain C progs need to change:

	#include <vips.h>

  to:

	#include <vips/vips.h>

  the C++ API should be unaltered
