.TH VIPSHEADER 1 "12 July 1990"
.SH NAME
vipsheader \- prints information about an image file
.SH SYNOPSIS
vipsheader [OPTIONS ...] files ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vipsheader(1)
prints image header fields to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -a, --all
Show all fields. Fields are displayed to be convenient for humans to
read, so binary data, for example, is summarized rather than simply printed.

.TP
.B -f FIELD, --field=FIELD
Print the value of
.B FIELD
from the image header. Fields are printed in a way suitable for programs to
understand, so, for example, binary data is base64-encoded and printed as a
stream of characters.

The special field name
.B getext
prints the VIPS extension block: the XML defining the image metadata. You can
alter this, then reattach with
.B vipsedit(1).

You can use multiple "-f" arguments to print the values
of many fields.

.SH EXAMPLES
 $ vipsheader -f width ~/pics/*.v
 1024
 1279
 22865
