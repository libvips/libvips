title: Introduction to nip4 
---

[nip4 is now mostly done](https://github.com/jcupitt/nip4)
so this post tries to introduce this strange tool for people who've not
come across it before.

If you used nip2, there's a [nip4 for nip2
users](https://www.libvips.org/2025/03/12/nip4-for-nip2-users.html) post
which runs though the main differences.

I'll write a "nip4 for nerds" post next week introducing nip4's programming
language.

## Background

nip4 is a free spreadsheet-like GUI for the [libvips image processing
library](https://www.libvips.org/) with binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac.
You can use it to build image processing pipelines, and then execute them on
large datasets. These pipelines can get quite complex --- I've made systems
with over 10,000 operations chained together.

This workspace analyses pulmonary PET-CT scans. It fits a two compartment
model to each lung voxel to estimate a rate constant for FDG uptake (a proxy
for inflammation).

Here's [the workspace developed in the Charisma
project](https://github.com/BritishMuseum/bm-charisma). 

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-charisma.png)

This workspace standardises and automates technical imaging in museums. You
can load visible, infrared, ultraviolet, UV-induced visible luminescence and
visible-induced IR luminescence images, and it computes a set of derivatives.
This screenshot shows calibrated visible and calibrated UV-induced visible 
luminescence with stray-light removal and Kubelkaâ€“Munk modelling of scatter.

## Why is it useful?

Because the underlying image processing engine is libvips, it's fast and
does not need a lot of memory. The Charisma workspace above, for example,
loads in about 5s on this PC, manipulates almost 100GB of images, but runs
in under 1GB of RAM:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-resources.png)

Everything is live. You can open an image view window on any of the
cells in the workspace and watch pixels change as you edit the formula.

The whole systems is lazy and demand-driven. You can load enormous images
(many 100s of gigabytes) and manipulate them interactively, since only the
pixels needed to update the screen actually get processed. When you do a final
save operation, it will take a while, of course.

nip4 comes with a separate program called `nip4-batch`. This is a batch-mode
processor that can load nip4 workspace files and execute them on a set of
inputs. You can use to apply a workspace you've developed in nip4 to a big
collection of images.

## The main window

When you start nip4, it looks something like this. I've loaded a test image
(drag one in, use the folder button at the top left, or start nip4 from the
command-line with `nip4 my-great-image.jpg`):

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-main-window.png)

`A` is the current column, `A1` is a row for the image you loaded, this is all
in `tab1`. The thing down the left is the set of loaded toolkits. 

The toolkit menu contains around 300 useful operations, and you can make more
yourself. You can click to move in and out of toolkits, or you can
click in the magnifying glass at the top and search for tools by keyword.

If you select Filter > Photographic Negative you'll see:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-negative.png)

Most tools take one argument, and they are applied to the bottom row 
in the current column. If you want to apply a tool to a row other than the
bottom one, select it first by clicking on the row label.

If you open up `A2` by clicking on the `V` down button next to the label,
you'll see the cell formula:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-formula.png)

So the function `Filter_negative_item.action` has been applied to the row `A1`.
You can edit the formula --- click on it, enter `255 - A1`, and you should see:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-formula2.png)

Which computes almost the same result.

Rows can contain many types of object. Click at the top of the toolkit
bar to get back to the start position, then click Widgets > Scale to add a
scale widget called `A3` to the workspace. Now edit the formula to be
`A3 - A1` and try dragging the slider. 

It looks a bit awkward with the result row `A2` positioned before the scale.
You can reorder columns by dragging on the row label. 

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-scale.png)

You can enter new formula in the text box at the bottom of the column.
Solarisation is a photographic technique where bright areas of the image
become inverted. 

This is easy to write as a formula.  nip4 does not have an undo operation,
instead it has fast and easy duplicate, merge and delete. If you make a
copy of column `A` before you start changing it, you can't lose any of your
current work.

Duplicate column `A` by right-clicking on the column title and selecting
Duplicate from the menu.  Right-click on `B3` and select Delete, so you have:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-duplicate.png)

Now in the text box at the bottom of column `B`, enter the formula:

```
if B1 < B2 then 255 * B1 / B2 else 255 * (255 - B1) / (255 - B2)
```

And try dragging scale `B2`. Hopefully you'll see a solarised image.
This operation is also in the standard toolkits, next to Photographic
Negative.

If you double-click on an image thumbnail, you'll open an image view window.
These are all live, so as you drag scales, they'll all update. You can zoom
in and watch the values of individual pixels change as you edit formula.

The main window has some other useful features. You can pan large workspaces
by dragging on the background, the burger menu at the top-right has some
useful options, there's a context menu on the workspace tab, and another one
on the workspace background.

The burger menu includes Recover After Crash, which lets you get any workspace
back if something bad happens (I hope it doesn't).

## The image view window

The nip4 image view window has a lot of useful shortcuts.

* Cursor keys to scroll around
* Cursor keys plus shift to move by a screen size
* Cursor keys plus Ctrl to move to image edges
* Number keys to pick a particular magnification
* Ctrl + number keys to pick a particular zoom out
* 0 for best fit
* 1 for 100% 
* d, to toggle debug rendering mode
* i, + / o, - to zoom in and out
* Ctrl-< / Ctrl-> for prev page, next page
* Alt-Left / Alt-Right for prev image, next image
* Mouse drag to pan
* Mousewheel to zoom
* Mousewheel + Shift/Ctrl to pan
* Ctrl-O replace image
* Ctrl-S save image
* Alt-Enter show properties
* Ctrl-C / Ctrl-V to copy paste of filenames, lists of filenames and images
* Drag and drop filenames, lists of filenames and images
* F11 fullscreen

If you select View > Display Control Bar, some widgets appear at the bottom.
They let you flip pages, move to animation frames, set a scale and offset
for each pixel (handy for scientific images), and a burger menu gives
a set of useful visualisation options such as false colour, log scale,
and colour management.

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-image-window.png)

You can also mark features on images. If you hold down Ctrl and drag down and
right, you'll create a rectangular region, if you drag up and left you'll mark
an arrow, if you just Ctrl-click you'll mark a point.

## Editing complex objects

All compound row objects can be edited. Back in the main window, try pressing
the down arrow next to the region a few times. You should see something like
this:

![nip4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nip4-compound.png)

You can edit any of these member values. For example, try setting `top` to
be a fixed value, like 900. Now go back to the image window and try dragging
`B8` --- you'll find it can only be dragged left-right, because the top edge
is now fixed in place.

You can use any formula you like. Try setting `height` to be the formula
`width * 2 ** 0.5`, that is, width times root two. Now you'll find `B8` can't
be sized vertically, but if you resize horizontally, the height will also
change to keep the region in the A paper aspect ratio.

## Other features

Each tab can have a set of private definitions in nip4's programming language.
Right-click on the workspace background and select Workspace Definitions.

All the tools and toolkits are implemented in this language too. Right-click
on the workspace background and select Edit Toolkits to change them. You can
write your own tools and toolkits.

You can select many rows and group them. When you perform an operation on
a group, it'll automatically operate on every row in the group.

Once you've set up a pipeline, you can open the image view window of the first
image and use the `<` and `>` buttons in the titlebar to step though all the
other images in the same directory.
