title: True streaming for libvips
---

An interesting feature has just landed in libvips git master (and should be
in the upcoming libvips 8.9): true streaming. This has been talked about
on and off for five years or more, but it's now finally happened! This post
explains what this feature is and why it could be useful.

# Overview

Previously, libvips let you use files and areas of memory as the source and
destination of image processing pipelines. 

The new `VipsConnection` classes let you connect image processing pipelines
efficiently to *any* kind of data object, for example, pipes. You can now
do this:

```
cat k2.jpg | \
  vips invert stdin[shrink=2] .jpg[Q=90] | \
    cat > x.jpg
```

The magic filename `"stdin"` opens a stream attached to file descriptor 0
(`stdin`), does `vips_image_new_from_source()`, and passes that image into
the operation. Writing to a filename with nothing before the suffix will
open a stream to `stdout` and write in that format.

# Why is this useful

To see why this is a useful thing to be able to do, imagine how something like
a thumbnailing service on S3 works.

S3 keeps data (images in this case) in *buckets* and lets you read and
write buckets using http `GET` and `POST` requests to addresses like
`http://johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg`.

Processing with a system that works in whole images, like
ImageMagick, happens like this:

![Processing with image-at-a-time systems](/assets/images/magick-s3.png)

Reading from the left, first the data is downloaded from the bucket into
a large area of memory, then the image is decompressed, then processed,
perhaps in several stages, then recompressed, then finally uploaded back
to cloud storage.

Each stage must complete before the next stage can start, and each stage
needs at least two large areas of memory to function.

Current libvips is able to execute decode, process and encode all at the same
time, in parallel, and without needing any intermediate images. It looks
more like this:

![Processing with current libvips](/assets/images/old-libvips-s3.png)

Because the middle sections are overlapped we get much better *latency*:
the total time the whole process takes from start to finish is much lower.

However, current libvips still needs the compressed input image to be read to
memory before it can start, and can't start to upload the result to cloud
storage until it has finished compressing the whole output image.

This is where true streaming comes in. libvips git master can now decode
directly from a pipe and encode directly to a pipe. It looks more like this:

Now *everything* overlaps, and latency should drop again.

# API

Here's how it looks in Python:

```python
source = pyvips.Source.new_from_descriptor(4132)
image = pyvips.Image.new_from_source(source, "")
if image.width > 1000:
    # big image! .. shrink on load
    image = pyvips.Image.new_from_source(source, "", shrink=2)
image = image.invert()
target = pyvips.Target.new_to_descriptor(2487)
image.write_to_target(target)
```

The neat part is that you can open the source twice, once to get the header
and decide how to process it, and a second time with the parameters you want.

Behind the scenes, the source is buffering bytes as they arrive from the
input. If you reuse the source, it'll automatically rewind and reuse the
buffered bytes until they run out. Once you switch from reading the header to
processing pixels, the buffer is discarded and bytes from the source are fed
directly into the decompressor.

The mechanism that supports this is set of calls loaders can use on sources to
hint what kind of access pattern they are likely to need, and what part of the
image (header, pixels) they are working on.

# Custom sources

libvips ships with streams that can attach to files, areas of memory, and file
descriptors (eg. pipes). 

You can add your own connection types by subclassing `VipsSource` and
`VipsTarget` and implementing `read` and `write` methods, but this can be
awkward for languages other than C or C++.

To make custom streams easy in languages like Python, there are classes called
`VipsSourceCustom` and `VipsTargetCustom`. You can make your own stream
objects like this:

```python
file = open(sys.argv[1], "rb")

def read_handler(size):
    return file.read(size)

source = pyvips.SourceCustom()
source.on_read(read_handler)
```

This makes a very simple source which just reads from a file.  Without a
seek handler, `Source` will treat this as a pipe and do automatic header
buffering.

Like any source, you can use it to make an image:

```python
image = pyvips.Image.new_from_source(source, '')
```

Or perhaps:

```python
image = pyvips.Image.thumbnail_source(source, 128)
```

You could make one with a seek handler like this:

```python
file = open(sys.argv[1], "rb")

def read_handler(size):
    return file.read(size)

def seek_handler(offset, whence):
    file.seek(offset, whence)
    return file.tell()

source = pyvips.Source()
source.on_read(read_handler)
source.on_seek(seek_handler)
```

A seek method is optional, but will help file formats like TIFF which seek
a lot during read.

# Custom output streams

Output streams are almost the same:

```python
file = open(sys.argv[2], "wb")

def write_handler(chunk):
    return file.write(chunk)

def finish_handler():
    file.close()

target = pyvips.TargetCustom()
target.on_write(write_handler)
target.on_finish(finish_handler)
```

So you can now do this!

```python
image = pyvips.Image.new_from_source(source, '')
image.write_to_target(target, '.png')
```

And it'll copy between your two objects.

# Loader and saver API

There's quite a large chunk of new API for loaders and savers to use to hook
themselves up to streams. We've rewritten jpg, png, webp, hdr (Radiance),
tif (though only load, not save), svg and ppm/pfm/pnm to work only via this
new class.

We plan to rework more loaders and savers in the next few libvips versions. The
old file and buffer API will become a thin layer over the new connection system.
