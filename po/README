translators
-----------

see this page for a howto:

	http://developer.gnome.org/doc/tutorials/gnome-i18n/translator.html

Things like 

	msgid "/File/_Save Image As ..."

are menu items. You only need to translate the last part (following the final
"/"). The underscore character marks the accelerator (the underlined character
in the menu item). So you could put:

	msgstr "Sevy i_mago os ..."

and it would display as "Sevy imago os ...", with the "m" underlined.

tips
----

intltool-update --pot

	make a new vips.pot translation template from the sources

:%s/msgstr ""/msgstr "Malkovich"/
:%s/msgstr\[0\] ""/msgstr[0] "Malkovich"/
:%s/msgstr\[1\] ""/msgstr[1] "Malkovich"/
:g/#, c-format/d

add header

# test translation file
#
msgid ""
msgstr ""
