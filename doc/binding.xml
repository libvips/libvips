</para>
<para>
  There are full libvips bindings for quite a few environments now: C, C++, command-line, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Python and JavaScript (node).
</para>
<para>
  This chapter runs through the four main styles that have been found to work well. If you want to write a new binding, one of these should be close to what you need.
</para>
<refsect3 xml:id="dont-bind-the-top-level-c-api">
  <title>Don’t bind the top-level C API</title>
  <para>
    The libvips C API (vips_add() and so on) was designed to be easy for humans to write. It is inconvenient and dangerous to use from other languages due to its heavy use of varargs.
  </para>
  <para>
    It’s much better to use the layer below. This lower layer is structured as:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Create operator. You can use vips_operation_new() to make a new <literal>VipsOperation</literal> object from an operator nickname, like <literal>&quot;add&quot;</literal>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Set parameters. You can loop over the operation with vips_argument_map() to get the name and type of each input argument. For each argument, you need to get the value from your language, convert to a <literal>GValue</literal>, then use g_object_set_property() to set that value on the operator.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Execute with vips_cache_operation_build().
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Extract results. Again, you loop over the operator arguments with vips_argument_map(), but instead of inputs, this time you look for output arguments. You extract their value with g_object_get_property(), and pass the value back to your language.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    For example, you can execute vips_invert() like this:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="c">
/* compile with
 *
 * gcc -g -Wall callvips.c `pkg-config vips --cflags --libs`
 *
 */

#include &lt;vips/vips.h&gt;

int
main( int argc, char **argv )
{
    VipsImage *in;
    VipsImage *out;
    VipsOperation *op;
    VipsOperation *new_op;
    GValue gvalue = { 0 };

    if( VIPS_INIT( argv[0] ) ) 
        /* This shows the vips error buffer and quits with a fail exit
         * code.
         */
        vips_error_exit( NULL ); 

    /* This will print a table of any ref leaks on exit, very handy for
     * development.
     */
    vips_leak_set( TRUE );

    if( argc != 3 )
        vips_error_exit( &quot;usage: %s input-filename output-filename&quot;, 
            argv[0] );

    if( !(in = vips_image_new_from_file( argv[1], NULL )) )
        vips_error_exit( NULL ); 

    /* Create a new operator from a nickname. NULL for unknown operator.
     */
    op = vips_operation_new( &quot;invert&quot; );

    /* Init a gvalue as an image, set it to in, use the gvalue to set the
     * operator property.
     */
    g_value_init( &amp;gvalue, VIPS_TYPE_IMAGE );
    g_value_set_object( &amp;gvalue, in );
    g_object_set_property( G_OBJECT( op ), &quot;in&quot;, &amp;gvalue );
    g_value_unset( &amp;gvalue );

    /* We no longer need in: op will hold a ref to it as long as it needs
     * it. 
     */
    g_object_unref( in ); 

    /* Call the operation. This will look up the operation+args in the vips
     * operation cache and either return a previous operation, or build
     * this one. In either case, we have a new ref we must release.
     */
    if( !(new_op = vips_cache_operation_build( op )) ) {
        g_object_unref( op );
        vips_error_exit( NULL ); 
    }
    g_object_unref( op );
    op = new_op;

    /* Now get the result from op. g_value_get_object() does not ref the
     * object, so we need to make a ref for out to hold.
     */
    g_value_init( &amp;gvalue, VIPS_TYPE_IMAGE );
    g_object_get_property( G_OBJECT( op ), &quot;out&quot;, &amp;gvalue );
    out = VIPS_IMAGE( g_value_get_object( &amp;gvalue ) );
    g_object_ref( out ); 
    g_value_unset( &amp;gvalue );

    /* All done: we can unref op. The output objects from op actually hold
     * refs back to it, so before we can unref op, we must unref them. 
     */
    vips_object_unref_outputs( VIPS_OBJECT( op ) ); 
    g_object_unref( op );

    if( vips_image_write_to_file( out, argv[2], NULL ) )
        vips_error_exit( NULL ); 

    g_object_unref( out );

    return( 0 ); 
}
</programlisting>
</refsect3>
<refsect3 xml:id="compiled-language-which-can-call-c">
  <title>Compiled language which can call C</title>
  <para>
    The C++ binding uses this lower layer to define a function called <literal>VImage::call()</literal> which can call any libvips operator with a set of variable arguments.
  </para>
  <para>
    A small Python program walks the set of all libvips operators and generates a set of static bindings. For example:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="c++">
VImage VImage::invert( VOption *options )
{
    VImage out;

    call( &quot;invert&quot;, (options ? options : VImage::option()) -&gt;
        set( &quot;in&quot;, *this ) -&gt;
        set( &quot;out&quot;, &amp;out ) );

    return( out );
}
</programlisting>
  <para>
    So from C++ you can call any libvips operator (though without static typechecking) with <literal>VImage::call()</literal>, or use the member functions on <literal>VImage</literal> to get type-checked calls for at least the required operator arguments.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <literal>VImage</literal> class also adds automatic reference counting, constant expansion, operator overloads, and various other useful features.
  </para>
</refsect3>
<refsect3 xml:id="dynamic-language-with-ffi">
  <title>Dynamic language with FFI</title>
  <para>
    Languages like Ruby, Python, JavaScript and LuaJIT can’t call C directly, but they do support FFI. The bindings for these languages work rather like C++, but use FFI to call into libvips and run operations.
  </para>
  <para>
    Since these languages are dynamic, they can add another trick: they intercept the method-missing hook and attempt to run any method calls not implemented by the <literal>Image</literal> class as libvips operators. In effect, the binding is generated at runtime.
  </para>
</refsect3>
<refsect3 xml:id="dynamic-langauge-without-ffi">
  <title>Dynamic langauge without FFI</title>
  <para>
    PHP does not have a useful FFI, unfortunately, so for this language a small C module implements the general <literal>vips_call()</literal> function for PHP language types, and a larger pure PHP layer makes it convenient to use.
  </para>
</refsect3>
<refsect3 xml:id="gobject-introspection">
  <title>gobject-introspection</title>
  <para>
    The C source code to libvips has been marked up with special comments describing the interface in a standard way. These comments are read by the <literal>gobject-introspection</literal> package when libvips is compiled and used to generate a typelib, a description of how to call the library. Many languages have gobject-introspection packages: all you need to do to call libvips from your favorite language is to start g-o-i, load the libvips typelib, and you should have the whole library available. For example, from Python it’s as simple as:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="python">
from gi.repository import Vips
</programlisting>
  <para>
    You can now use all of the libvips introspection machinery, as noted above.
  </para>
  <para>
    Unfortunately g-o-i has some strong disadvantages. It is not very portable, since you will need a g-o-i layer for whatever platform you are targetting; it does not cross-compile well, since typelibs include a lot of very-low level data (such as exact structure layouts); and installation for your users is likely to be tricky.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you have a choice, I would recommend simply using FFI.
  </para>
</refsect3>
<refsect3 xml:id="documentation">
  <title>Documentation</title>
  <para>
    You can generate searchable docs from a <code>.gir</code> (the thing that is built from scanning libvips and which in turn turn the typelib is made from) with <command>g-ir-doc-tool</command>, for example:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ g-ir-doc-tool --language=Python -o ~/mydocs Vips-8.0.gir
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Then to view them, either:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ yelp ~/mydocs 
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Or perhaps:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ cd ~/mydocs 
$ yelp-build html .
</programlisting>
  <para>
    To make HTML docs. This is an easy way to see what you can call in the library.
  </para>
