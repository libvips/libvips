Title: Using libvips from C++

libvips comes with a convenient C++ API. It is a very thin wrapper over the
C API and adds automatic reference counting, exceptions, operator
overloads, and automatic constant expansion.

See the [C++ API documentation](https://www.libvips.org/API/current/cpp/)
for more details.
