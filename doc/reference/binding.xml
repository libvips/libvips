    <para>
      The C source code 
      to libvips has been marked up with special comments describing the 
      interface in a standard way. These comments are read by 
      gobject-introspection
      when libvips is compiled and used to generate a 
      typelib, a description of how to call the library. Many languages have 
      gobject-introspection packages: all you need to do to call libvips
      from your favorite language is to start g-o-i, load the libvips typelib,
      and you should have the whole library available. For example, from 
      Python it's as simple as:

<programlisting language="Python">
from gi.repository import Vips
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      libvips used in this way is likely to be rather bare-bones. For Python,
      we wrote a set of overrides which layer a more Pythonesque interface
      on top of the one provided for libvips by pygobject. These overrides
      are simply a set of Python classes.

    <para>
      To call a vips operation, you'll need to make a new operation with
      vips_operation_new() (all it does is look up the operation by name
      with vips_type_find(), then call g_object_new() for you), then
      use vips_argument_map() and friends to loop over the operation's
      arguments setting them. Once you have set all arguments, use
      vips_cache_operation_build() to look up the operation in the cache
      and either build or dup it. If something goes wrong, you'll need
      to use vips_object_unref_outputs() and g_object_unref() to free the
      partially-built object.
      The Python binding uses this technique to implement a function which
      can call any vips operation, turning optional vips arguments into
      Python keyword arguments.
    </para>

    <para>
      If your language does not have a gobject-introspection package, you'll 
      need to write something in C or C++ doing approximately the same thing. 
      The C++ API takes this route.
