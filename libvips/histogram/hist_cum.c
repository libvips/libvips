/* histogram cumulativisation
 *
 * Author: N. Dessipris
 * Written on: 02/08/1990
 * 24/5/95 JC
 *	- tidied up and ANSIfied
 * 20/7/95 JC
 *	- smartened up again
 *	- now works for hists >256 elements
 * 3/3/01 JC
 *	- broken into cum and norm ... helps im_histspec()
 *	- better behaviour for >8 bit hists
 * 31/10/05 JC
 * 	- was broken for vertical histograms, gah
 * 	- neater im_histnorm()
 * 23/7/07
 * 	- eek, off by 1 for more than 1 band hists
 * 12/5/08
 * 	- histcum works for signed hists now as well
 * 24/3/10
 * 	- gtkdoc
 * 	- small cleanups
 * 12/8/13	
 * 	- redone im_histcum() as a class, vips_hist_cum()
