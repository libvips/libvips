 * VipsDemandStyle:
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_SMALLTILE: demand in small (typically 64x64 pixel) tiles
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_FATSTRIP: demand in fat (typically 10 pixel high) strips
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_THINSTRIP: demand in thin (typically 1 pixel high) strips
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_ANY: demand geometry does not matter
 *
 * See vips_demand_hint(). Operations can hint to the VIPS image IO system about
 * the kind of demand geometry they prefer. 
 *
 * These demand styles are given below in order of increasing
 * restrictiveness.  When demanding output from a pipeline, 
 * vips_image_generate()
 * will use the most restrictive of the styles requested by the operations 
 * in the pipeline.
 *
 * #VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_THINSTRIP --- This operation would like to output strips 
 * the width of the image and a few pels high. This is option suitable for 
 * point-to-point operations, such as those in the arithmetic package.
 *
 * This option is only efficient for cases where each output pel depends 
 * upon the pel in the corresponding position in the input image.
 *
 * #VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_FATSTRIP --- This operation would like to output strips 
 * the width of the image and as high as possible. This option is suitable 
 * for area operations which do not violently transform coordinates, such 
 * as im_conv(). 
 *
 * #VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_SMALLTILE --- This is the most general demand format.
 * Output is demanded in small (around 100x100 pel) sections. This style works 
 * reasonably efficiently, even for bizzare operations like 45 degree rotate.
 *
 * #VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_ANY --- This image is not being demand-read from a disc 
 * file (even indirectly) so any demand style is OK. It's used for things like
 * im_black() where the pixels are calculated.
 *
 * See also: vips_demand_hint().
