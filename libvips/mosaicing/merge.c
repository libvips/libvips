/**
 * vips_merge:
 * @ref: reference image
 * @sec: secondary image
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @direction: horizontal or vertical merge
 * @dx: displacement of ref from sec
 * @dy: displacement of ref from sec
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 * 
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * * @mblend: %gint, maximum blend size 
 *
 * This operation joins two images left-right (with @ref on the left) or
 * up-down (with @ref above) with a smooth seam.
 *
 * If the number of bands differs, one of the images 
 * must have one band. In this case, an n-band image is formed from the 
 * one-band image by joining n copies of the one-band image together, and then
 * the two n-band images are operated upon.
 *
 * The two input images are cast up to the smallest common type (see table 
 * Smallest common format in 
 * <link linkend="libvips-arithmetic">arithmetic</link>).
 *
 * @dx and @dy give the displacement of @sec relative to @ref, in other words,
 * the vector to get from the origin of @sec to the origin of @ref, in other
 * words, @dx will generally be a negative number. 
 *
 * @mblend limits  the  maximum width of the
 * blend area.  A value of "-1" means "unlimited". The two images are blended 
 * with a raised cosine. 
 *
 * Pixels with all bands equal to zero are "transparent", that
 * is, zero pixels in the overlap area do not  contribute  to  the  merge.
 * This makes it possible to join non-rectangular images.
 *
 * See also: vips_mosaic(), vips_insert().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
