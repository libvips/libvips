 * @xref: position in reference image
 * @yref: position in reference image
 * @xsec: position in secondary image

 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 * 
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * * @bandno: %gint, band to search for features
 * * @hwindow: %gint, half window size
 * * @harea: %gint, half search size 
 * * @mblend: %gint, maximum blend size

 * * @angle1: %gdouble, output, detected first order rotation
 * * @dx1: %gdouble, output, detected first order displacement
 * * @dy1: %gdouble, output, detected first order displacement
 *
 * This operation joins two images left-right (with @ref on the left) or
 * top-bottom (with @ref above) given an approximate overlap.
 *
 * @sec is positioned so that the pixel (@xsec, @ysec) in @sec lies on top of 
 * the pixel (@xref, @yref) in @ref. The overlap area is divided into three
 * sections, 20 high-contrast points in band @bandno of image @ref are found 
 * in each, and a window of pixels of size @hwindow around each high-contrast 
 * point is searched for in @sec over an area of @harea. 
 *
 * A linear model is fitted to the 60 tie-points, points a long way from the
 * fit are discarded, and the model refitted until either too few points
 * remain or the model reaches good agreement. 
 *
 * The detected displacement is used with vips_merge() to join the two images
 * together. 
 *
 * You can read out the detected transform with @dx0, @dy0, @scale1, @angle1,
 * @dx1, @dy1.
 *
 * See also: vips_merge(), vips_insert().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
