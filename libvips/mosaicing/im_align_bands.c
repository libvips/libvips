/**
 * im_align_bands:
 * @in: image to align
 * @out: output image
 *
 * This operation uses im_phasecor_fft() to find an integer displacement to
 * align all image bands band 0. It is very slow and not very accurate. 
 *
 * Use im_estpar() in preference: it's fast and accurate.
 * 
 * See also: im_global_balancef(), im_remosaic().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
