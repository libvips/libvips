 * im_correl:
 * @ref: reference image
 * @sec: secondary image
 * @xref: position in reference image
 * @yref: position in reference image
 * @xsec: position in secondary image
 * @ysec: position in secondary image
 * @hwindowsize: half window size
 * @hsearchsize: half search size 
 * @correlation: return detected correlation
 * @x: return found position
 * @y: return found position
 *
 * This operation finds the position of @sec within @ref. 
 *
 * The area around
 * (@xsec, @ysec) is searched for the best match to the area around (@xref,
 * @yref). It  searches an area of size @hsearchsize for a
 * match of size @hwindowsize.  The position of the best match is
 * returned, together with the correlation at that point.
 *
 * Only  the  first  band  of each image is correlated. @ref and @sec may be
 * very large --- the function  extracts  and  generates  just  the
 * parts needed.  Correlation is done with im_spcor(); the position of
 * the maximum is found with im_maxpos().
 * 
 * See also: im_match_linear(), im_match_linear_search(), im_lrmosaic().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
