/* @(#)  Function which improves the selection of tiepoints carried out by 
 * @(#) im_clinear() until no points have deviation greater than 1 pixel
 * @(#) No reference or secondary images are involved
 * @(#) Function im_improve assumes that im_clinear has been applied on points
 * @(#) No IMAGES are involved in this function and the result is

 * @(#) TIE_POINTS *inpoints, *outpoints;
 * @(#) 
 * @(#) Returns 0 on sucess  and -1 on error.
