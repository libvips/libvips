/**
 * im_tbmosaic:
 * @ref: reference image
 * @sec: secondary image
 * @out: output image
 * @bandno: band to search for features
 * @xref: position in reference image
 * @yref: position in reference image
 * @xsec: position in secondary image
 * @ysec: position in secondary image
 * @hwindowsize: half window size
 * @hsearchsize: half search size 
 * @balancetype: no longer used
 * @mwidth: maximum blend width
 *
 * This operation joins two images top-bottom (with @ref on the top) 
 * given an approximate overlap.
 *
 * @sec is positioned so that the pixel (@xsec, @ysec) lies on top of the
 * pixel in @ref at (@xref, @yref). The overlap area is divided into three
 * sections, 20 high-contrast points in band @bandno of image @ref are found 
 * in each, and each high-contrast point is searched for in @sec using
 * @hwindowsize and @hsearchsize (see im_correl()). 
 *
 * A linear model is fitted to the 60 tie-points, points a long way from the
 * fit are discarded, and the model refitted until either too few points
 * remain or the model reaches good agreement. 
 *
 * The detected displacement is used with im_tbmerge() to join the two images
 * together. 
 *
 * @mwidth limits  the  maximum height of the
 * blend area.  A value of "-1" means "unlimited". The two images are blended 
 * with a raised cosine. 
 *
 * Pixels with all bands equal to zero are "transparent", that
 * is, zero pixels in the overlap area do not  contribute  to  the  merge.
 * This makes it possible to join non-rectangular images.
 *
 * If the number of bands differs, one of the images 
 * must have one band. In this case, an n-band image is formed from the 
 * one-band image by joining n copies of the one-band image together, and then
 * the two n-band images are operated upon.
 *
 * The two input images are cast up to the smallest common type (see table 
 * Smallest common format in 
 * <link linkend="VIPS-arithmetic">arithmetic</link>).
 *
 * See also: im_tbmerge(), im_lrmosaic(), im_insert(), im_global_balance().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
