/**
 * vips_mask_ideal:
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @width: image size
 * @height: image size
 * @frequency_cutoff: threshold at which filter ends
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * * @nodc: don't set the DC pixel
 * * @reject: invert the filter sense
 * * @optical: coordinates in optical space
 * * @uchar: output a uchar image
 *
 * Make an ideal high- or low-pass filter, that is, one with a sharp cutoff
 * positioned at @frequency_cutoff, where @frequency_cutoff is in
 * the range 0 - 1.
 *
 * This operation creates a one-band float image of the specified size. 
 * The image has
 * values in the range [0, 1] and is typically used for multiplying against 
 * frequency domain images to filter them.
 * Masks are created with the DC component at (0, 0). The DC pixel always
 * has the value 1.0.
 *
 * Set @nodc to not set the DC pixel. 
 *
 * Set @optical to position the DC component in the centre of the image. This
 * makes the mask suitable for multiplying against optical Fourier transforms. 
 * See vips_wrap(). 
 *
 * Set @reject to invert the sense of
 * the filter. For example, low-pass becomes low-reject. 
 *
 * Set @uchar to output an 8-bit unsigned char image rather than a
 * float image. In this case, pixels are in the range [0 - 255].
 *
 * See also: vips_mask_ideal(), vips_mask_ideal_ring(), 
 * vips_mask_ideal_band(), vips_mask_butterworth(), 
 * vips_mask_butterworth_ring(), vips_mask_butterworth_band(), 
 * vips_mask_gaussian(), vips_mask_gaussian_ring(), 
 * vips_mask_gaussian_band(). 
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
