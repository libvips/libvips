 * vips_csvsave:
 * @in: image to save 
 * @filename: file to write to
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * @separator: separator string
 *
 * Writes the pixels in @in to the @filename as CSV (comma-separated values).
 * The image is written
 * one line of text per scanline. Complex numbers are written as 
 * "(real,imaginary)" and will need extra parsing I guess. Only the first band
 * is written. 
 *
 * @separator gives the string to use to separate numbers in the output. 
 * The default is "\\t" (tab).
 *
 * See also: vips_image_write_file().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
