/**
 * vips_ppmsave:
 * @in: image to save 
 * @filename: file to write to
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * @ascii: save as ASCII rather than binary
 *
 * Write a VIPS image to a file as PPM. It can write 8, 16 or
 * 32 bit unsigned integer images, float images, colour or monochrome, 
 * stored as binary or ASCII. 
 * Integer images of more than 8 bits can only be stored in ASCII.
 *
 * When writing float (PFM) images the scale factor is set from the 
 * "pfm-scale" metadata.
 *
 * Set @ascii to %TRUE to write as human-readable ASCII. Normally data is
 * written in binary. 
 *
 * The storage format is indicated by a filename extension. Use one of .pbm,
 * .pgm, .ppm, .pfm. 
 *
 * See also: vips_image_write_file().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
