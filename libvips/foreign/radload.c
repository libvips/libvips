/**
 * vips_radload:
 * @filename: file to load
 * @out: output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Read a Radiance (HDR) file into a VIPS image. 
 *
 * Radiance files are read as #VIPS_CODING_RAD. They have one byte for each of
 * red, green and blue, and one byte of shared exponent. Some operations (like
 * vips_extract_area()) can work directly with images in this format, but 
 * mmany (all the arithmetic operations, for example) will not. Unpack 
 * #VIPS_CODING_RAD images to 3 band float with im_rad2float() if you want to do
 * arithmetic on them.
 *
 * This operation ignores some header fields, like VIEW and DATE. It will not 
 * rotate/flip as the FORMAT string asks.
 *
 * Sections of this reader from Greg Ward and Radiance with kind permission. 
 *
 * See also: vips_image_new_from_file().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
