/* save to raw
 *
 * Write raw image data to file. Useful when defining new formats...
 *
 * Jesper Friis
 *
 * 10/06/08 JF
 * 	- initial code based on im_vips2ppm()
 * 04/07/08 JF
 * 	- replaced FILE with plain file handlers for reducing
 * 	  confusion about binary vs. non-binary file modes.
 * 4/2/10
 * 	- gtkdoc
 * 15/12/11
 * 	- rework as a class
 * 	- added save raw to filename
 * 21/04/24 akash-akya
 * 	- reworked based on ppmsave.c
 * 	- added save to target
 * 	- added save to buffer
 * 	- deprecate vips_rawsave_fd()
