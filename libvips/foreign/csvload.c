/**
 * vips_csvload:
 * @filename: file to load
 * @out: output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * @skip: skip this many lines at start of file
 * @lines: read this many lines from file
 * @whitespace: set of whitespace characters
 * @separator: set of separator characters
 *
 * Load a CSV (comma-separated values) file. The output image is always 1 
 * band (monochrome), #VIPS_FORMAT_DOUBLE. 
 *
 * Items in lines can be either floating point numbers in the C locale, or 
 * strings enclosed in double-quotes ("), or empty.
 * You can use a backslash (\) within the quotes to escape special characters,
 * such as quote marks.
 *
 * The reader is deliberately rather fussy: it will fail if there are any 
 * short lines, or if the file is too short. It will ignore lines that are 
 * too long.
 *
 * @skip sets the number of lines to skip at the start of the file. 
 * Default zero.
 *
 * @lines sets the number of lines to read from the file. Default -1, 
 * meaning read all lines to end of file.
 *
 * @whitespace sets the skippable whitespace characters. 
 * Default <emphasis>space</emphasis>.
 * Whitespace characters are always run together.
 *
 * @separator sets the characters that separate fields. 
 * Default ;,<emphasis>tab</emphasis>. Separators are never run together.
 *
 * See also: vips_image_new_from_file().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
