 * SECTION: foreign
 * @short_description: load and save images in a variety of formats
 * @stability: Stable
 * @see_also: <link linkend="libvips-image">image</link>
 * @include: vips/vips.h
 *
 * This set of operations load and save images in a variety of formats. 
 *
 * The operations share a base class that offers a simple way to search for a
 * subclass of #VipsForeign which can load a certain file (see
 * vips_foreign_find_load()) or which could be used to save an image to a
 * certain file type (see vips_foreign_find_save()). You can then run these
 * operations using vips_call() and friends to perform the load or save.
 *
 * A pair of convenience
 * functions, vips_foreign_load() and vips_foreign_save(), automate the
 * process, loading an image from a file or saving an image to a file. These
 * functions let you give load or save options as name - value pairs in the C
 * argument list. You can use vips_foreign_load_options() and
 * vips_foreign_save_options() to include options in the file name.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * |[
 * vips_foreign_save (my_image, "frank.tiff", 
 *     "compression", VIPS_FOREIGN_TIFF_COMPRESSION_JPEG,
 *     NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * Will save an image to the file "frank.tiff" in TIFF format (selected by
 * the file name extension) with JPEG compression.
 *
 * |[
 * vips_foreign_save_options (my_image, "frank.tiff[compression=jpeg]");  
 * ]|
 *
 * Is the same thing, but with the option in the filename.
 *
 * You can also invoke the operations directly, for example:
 *
 * |[
 * vips_tiffsave (my_image, "frank.anything", 
 *     "compression", VIPS_FOREIGN_TIFF_COMPRESSION_JPEG,
 *     NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * To add support for a new file format to vips, simply define a new subclass
 * of #VipsForeignLoad or #VipsForeignSave. 
 *
 * If you define a new operation which is a subclass of #VipsForeign, support 
 * for it automatically appears in all VIPS user-interfaces. It will also be
 * transparently supported by vips_image_new_from_file() and friends.
 *
 * VIPS comes with VipsForeign for TIFF, JPEG, PNG, Analyze, PPM, OpenEXR, CSV,
 * Matlab, Radiance, RAW, FITS and VIPS. It also 
 * includes import filters which can
 * load with libMagick and with OpenSlide.

/**
 * VipsForeignFlags: 
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_NONE: no flags set
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_PARTIAL: the image may be read lazilly
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_SEQUENTIAL: top-to-bottom lazy reading
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_BIGENDIAN: image pixels are most-significant byte first
 *
 * Some hints about the image loader.
 *
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_PARTIAL means that the image can be read directly from the
 * file without needing to be unpacked to a temporary image first. 
 *
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_SEQUENTIAL means that the loader supports lazy reading, but
 * only top-to-bottom (sequential) access. Formats like PNG can read sets of
 * scanlines, for example, but only in order. 
 *
 * If neither PARTIAL or SEQUENTIAL is set, the loader only supports whole
 * image read. Setting both PARTIAL and SEQUENTIAL is an error.
 *
 * @VIPS_FOREIGN_BIGENDIAN means that image pixels are most-significant byte
 * first. Depending on the native byte order of the host machine, you may
 * need to swap bytes. See vips_copy().

 * @xres; horizontal resolution in pixels/mm
 * @yres; vertical resolution in pixels/mm
 * @bigtiff; write a BigTiff file
 *
 * Write a VIPS image to a file as TIFF.
 *
 * Use @compression to set the tiff compression. Currently jpeg, packbits,
 * fax4, lzw, none and deflate are supported. The default is no compression.
 * JPEG compression is a good lossy compressor for photographs, packbits is 
 * good for 1-bit images, and deflate is the best lossless compression TIFF 
 * can do. LZW has patent problems and is no longer recommended.
 *
 * Use @Q to set the JPEG compression factor. Default 75.
 *
 * Use @predictor to set the predictor for lzw and deflate compression. 
 *
 * Predictor is not set by default. There are three predictor values recognised
 * at the moment (2007, July): 1 is no prediction, 2 is a horizontal 
 * differencing and 3 is a floating point predictor. Refer to the libtiff 
 * specifications for further discussion of various predictors. In short, 
 * predictor helps to better compress image, especially in case of digital 
 * photos or scanned images and bit depths > 8. Try it to find whether it 
 * works for your images.
 *
 * Use @profile to give the filename of a profile to be embedded in the TIFF.
 * This does not affect the pixels which are written, just the way 
 * they are tagged. You can use the special string "none" to mean 
 * "don't attach a profile".
 *
 * If no profile is specified and the VIPS header 
 * contains an ICC profile named VIPS_META_ICC_NAME ("icc-profile-data"), the
 * profile from the VIPS header will be attached.
 *
 * Set @tile to TRUE to write a tiled tiff.  By default tiff are written in
 * strips. Use @tile_width and @tile_height to set the tile size. The defaiult
 * is 128 by 128.
 *
 * Set @pyramid to write the image as a set of images, one per page, of
 * decreasing size. 
 *
 * Set @squash to make 8-bit uchar images write as 1-bit TIFFs with zero
 * pixels written as 0 and non-zero as 1.
 *
 * Use @resunit to override the default resolution unit.  
 * The default 
 * resolution unit is taken from the header field "resolution-unit"
 * (#VIPS_META_RESOLUTION_UNIT in C). If this field is not set, then 
 * VIPS defaults to cm.
 *
 * Use @xres and @yres to override the default horizontal and vertical
 * resolutions. By default these values are taken from the VIPS image header. 
 * libvips resolution is always in pixels per millimetre.
 *
 * Set @bigtiff to attempt to write a bigtiff. 
 * Bigtiff is a variant of the TIFF
 * format that allows more than 4GB in a file.

 *
 * Read a JPEG file into a VIPS image. It can read most 8-bit JPEG images,

 *
 * @shrink means shrink by this integer factor during load.  Possible values 
 * are 1, 2, 4 and 8. Shrinking during read is very much faster than 
 * decompressing the whole image and then shrinking later.
 *
 * Setting @fail to true makes the JPEG reader fail on any warnings. 
 * This can be useful for detecting truncated files, for example. Normally 
 * reading these produces a warning, but no fatal error.  
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * |[

 * ]|
 *
 * Any embedded ICC profiles are ignored: you always just get the RGB from

 * vips_icc_import() to get CIE values from the file. 
 *
 * EXIF metadata is attached as @VIPS_META_EXIF_NAME ("exif-data"), IPCT as
 * @VIPS_META_IPCT_NAME ("ipct-data"), and XMP as VIPS_META_XMP_NAME
 * ("xmp-data").
 *
 * The int metadata item "jpeg-multiscan" is set to the result of

 * images differently.
 *
 * The EXIF thumbnail, if present, is attached to the image as 
 * "jpeg-thumbnail-data". See vips_image_get_blob().
 *
 * This function only reads the image header and does not decompress any pixel
 * data. Decompression only occurs when pixels are accessed by some other
