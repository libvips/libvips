 * 17/11/93 JC
 * 	- adapted from im_LabS2LabQ()
 * 16/11/94 JC
 *	- adapted to new im_wrap_oneonebuf() function
 * 15/6/95 JC
 *	- oops! rounding was broken
 * 6/6/95 JC
 *	- added round-to-nearest
 *	- somewhat slower ...
 * 21/12/99 JC
 * 	- a/b ==0 rounding was broken
 * 2/11/09
 * 	- gtkdoc, cleanup
 * 21/9/12
 * 	- redo as a class
