/* I ordered this paper from the library and it took ages. For reference, the
 * recommended short formula are:
 *
 * Lucs 
 * 	= 1.744 * L, L < 16
 * 	= (1/l) * (21.75 * ln(L) + 0.3838 * L - 38.54), otherwise
 *
 * Cucs = (l/c) * (0.162 * C + 10.92 * (ln(0.638 + 0.07216 * C)) + 4.907)
 *
 * hucs = h + D * f
 * where
 *	D = k4 + k5 * P * | P | ** k6
 *	P = cos(k7 * h + k8)
 *	f = (C ** 4 / (C ** 4 + 1900)) ** 0.5
 *
 * h		k4	k5	k6	k7 	k8
 * 0 - 49	133.87	-134.5	-0.924	1.727	340
 * 49 - 110	11.78	-12.7	-0.218	2.120	333
 * 110 - 269.5	13.87	10.93	0.140	1.000	-83
 * 269.5 - 360	0.14	5.23	0.170	1.610	233
 *
 * They have a much more complicated but slightly more accurate formula for 
 * hucs. This one is pretty good, simple approximation.
