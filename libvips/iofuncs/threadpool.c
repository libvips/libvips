/* Support for thread pools ... like threadgroups, but lighter.
 * 
 * 18/3/10
 * 	- from threadgroup.c
 * 	- distributed work allocation idea from Christian Blenia, thank you
 * 	  very much
 * 21/3/10
 * 	- progress feedback
 * 	- only expose VipsThreadState
 * 11/5/10
 * 	- argh, stopping many threads could sometimes leave allocated work
 * 	  undone
 * 17/7/10
 * 	- set pool->error whenever we set thr->error, lets us catch allocate
 * 	  errors (thanks Tim)
 * 25/7/14
 * 	- limit nthr on tiny images
 * 6/3/17
 * 	- remove single-thread-first-request thing, new seq system makes it
 * 	  unnecessary
 * 23/4/17
 * 	- add ->stall
 * 	- don't depend on image width when setting n_lines
 * 27/2/19 jtorresfabra
 * 	- free threadpool earlier 
 * 02/02/20 kleisauke
 *	- reuse threads by using GLib's threadpool
 * 	- remove mutex lock for VipsThreadStartFn

 *
 * A threadpool which allows reusing already started threads. Implementing
 * this can be tedious and error-prone. Therefore we use the GLib
 * provided threadpool for our convenience. An added advantage is, that
 * the threads can be shared between the different subsystems, when they
 * are using GLib.
 *
 * The threadpool is created during vips_init() and is destroyed by
 * vips_shutdown().
 *
 * vips_threadpool_run() loops a set of threads over an image. Threads take it
 * in turns to allocate units of work (a unit might be a tile in an image),
 * then run in parallel to process those units. An optional progress function
 * can be used to give feedback.

 * @im: image to loop over
 * @start: allocate per-thread state
 * @allocate: allocate a work unit
 * @work: process a work unit
 * @progress: give progress feedback about a work unit, or %NULL
 * @a: client data
 *
 * This function runs a set of threads over an image. It will use a newly
 * created or reused thread within the #VipsThreadPool. Each thread first calls
 * @start to create new per-thread state, then runs
 * @allocate to set up a new work unit (perhaps the next tile in an image, for
 * example), then @work to process that work unit. After each unit is
 * processed, @progress is called, so that the operation can give
 * progress feedback. @progress may be %NULL.
 *
 * The object returned by @start must be an instance of a subclass of
 * #VipsThreadState. Use this to communicate between @allocate and @work. 
 *
 * @allocate is always single-threaded (so it can write to the 
 * per-pool state), whereas @start and @work can be executed concurrently.
 * @progress is always called by 
 * the main thread (ie. the thread which called vips_threadpool_run()).
 *
 * See also: vips_concurrency_set().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, or -1 on error.
