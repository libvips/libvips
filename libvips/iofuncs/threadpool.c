/* Support for thread pools ... like threadgroups, but lighter.
 * 
 * 18/3/10
 * 	- from threadgroup.c
 * 	- distributed work allocation idea from Christian Blenia, thank you
 * 	  very much
 * 21/3/10
 * 	- progress feedback
 * 	- only expose VipsThreadState
 * 11/5/10
 * 	- argh, stopping many threads could sometimes leave allocated work
 * 	  undone
 * 17/7/10
 * 	- set pool->error whenever we set thr->error, lets us catch allocate
 * 	  errors (thanks Tim)
