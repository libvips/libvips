/*
 * Vertex-Split Quadratic B-Splines (VSQBS) is a brand new method
 * which consists of vertex-split subdivision, a subdivision method
 * with the (as yet unknown?) property that data which is (locally)
 * constant on diagonals is subdivided into data which is (locally)
 * constant on diagonals, followed by quadratic B-Spline smoothing.
 * Because both methods are linear, their combination can be
 * implemented as if there is no subdivision.
 *
 * At high enlargement ratios, VSQBS is very effective at "masking"
 * that the original has pixels uniformly distributed on a grid. In
 * particular, VSQBS produces resamples with only very mild
 * staircasing. Like cubic B-Spline smoothing, however, VSQBS is not
 * an interpolatory method. For example, using VSQBS to perform the
 * identity geometric transformation (enlargement by a scaling factor
 * equal to 1) on an image does not return the original: VSQBS
 * effectively smooths out the image with the convolution mask
 *
 *     1/8
 * 1/8 1/2 1/8
 *     1/8
 *
 * which is a fairly moderate blur (although the checkerboard mode is
 * in its nullspace).
 *
 * By blending VSQBS with an interpolatory method (bilinear, say) in a
 * transformation adaptive environment (current GEGL, for example), it
 * is quite easy to restore that resampling for identity geometric
 * transformation is equivalent to the identity, and rotations are not
 * affected by the above, implicit, blur. Contact N. Robidoux for
 * details.
 *
 * An article on VSQBS is forthcoming.

 * THE STENCIL OF INPUT VALUES:
 *
 * Pointer arithmetic is used to implicitly reflect the input stencil
 * about dos_two---assumed closer to the sampling location than other
 * pixels (ties are OK)---in such a way that after reflection the
 * sampling point is to the bottom right of dos_two.
 *
 * The following code and picture assumes that the stencil reflexion
 * has already been performed. (X is the sampling location.)
 *
 *
 *               (ix,iy-1)    (ix+1,iy-1)
 *               = uno_two    = uno_thr
 *
 *
 *
 *  (ix-1,iy)    (ix,iy)      (ix+1,iy)
 *  = dos_one    = dos_two    = dos_thr
 *                       X
 *
 *
 *  (ix-1,iy+1)  (ix,iy+1)    (ix+1,iy+1)
 *  = tre_one    = tre_two    = tre_thr
 *
 *
 * The above input pixel values are the ones needed in order to
 * IMPLICITLY make available the following values, needed by quadratic
 * B-Splines, which is performed on (shifted) double density data:
 *
 *
 *  uno_one_1 =      uno_two_1 =      uno_thr_1 =
 *  (ix-1/4,iy-1/4)  (ix+1/4,iy-1/4)  (ix+3/4,iy-1/4)
 *
 *
 *
 *                 X            or X
 *  dos_one_1 =      dos_two_1 =      dos_thr_1 =
 *  (ix-1/4,iy+1/4)  (ix+1/4,iy+1/4)  (ix+3/4,iy+1/4)
 *              or X            or X
 *
 *
 *
 *  tre_one_1 =      tre_two_1 =      tre_thr_1 =
 *  (ix-1/4,iy+3/4)  (ix+1/4,iy+3/4)  (ix+3/4,iy+3/4)
 *
 *
 * In the coefficient computations, we fix things so that coordinates
 * are relative to dos_two_1, and so that distances are rescaled so
 * that double density pixel locations are at a distance of 1.
