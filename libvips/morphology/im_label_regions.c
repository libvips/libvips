/**
 * im_label_regions:
 * @test: image to test
 * @mask: write labelled regions here
 * @segments: return number of regions here
 *
 * im_label_regions() repeatedly scans @test for regions of 4-connected pixels
 * with the same pixel value. Every time a region is discovered, those
 * pixels are marked in @mask with a unique serial number. Once all pixels
 * have been labelled, the operation returns, setting @segments to the number
 * of discrete regions which were detected.
 *
 * @mask is always a 1-band %IM_BANDFMT_UINT image of the same dimensions as
 * @test.
 *
 * This operation is useful for, for example, blob counting. You can use the
 * morphological operators to detect and isolate a series of objects, then use
 * im_label_regions() to number them all.
 *
 * Use im_histindexed() to (for example) find blob coordinates.
 *
 * See also: im_histindexed()
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
