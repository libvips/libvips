/**
 * vips_hough_circle: (method)
 * @in: input image
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * * @scale: scale down dimensions by this much
 * * @min_radius: smallest radius to search for
 * * @max_radius: largest radius to search for
 *
 * Find the circular Hough transform of an image. @in must be one band, with
 * non-zero pixels for image edges. @out is three-band, with the third channel 
 * representing the detected circle radius. The operation scales the number of
 * votes by circle circumference so circles of differing size are given equal
 * weight. 
 *
 * The output pixel at (x, y, band) is the strength of the circle centred on
 * (x, y) and with radius (band).
 *
 * Use @max_radius and @min_radius to set the range of radii to search for.
 *
 * Use @scale to set how @in coordinates are scaled to @out coordinates. A
 * @scale of 3, for example, will make @out 1/3rd of the width and height of
 * @in, and reduce the number of radii tested (and hence the number of bands
 * int @out) by a factor of three as well.
 *
 * See also: vips_hough_line().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
