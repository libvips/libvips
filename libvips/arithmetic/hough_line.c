/**
 * vips_hough_line: (method)
 * @in: input image
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * * @width: horizontal size of parameter space
 * * @height: vertical size of parameter space
 *
 * Find the line Hough transform for @in. @in must have one band. @out has one
 * band, with pixels being the number of votes for that line. The X dimension
 * of @out is the line angle in 0 - 180 degrees, the Y dimension is the 
 * distance of the closest part of that line to the origin in the top-left. 
 *
 * Use @width @height to set the size of the parameter space image (@out),
 * that is, how accurate the line determination should be. 
 *
 * See also: vips_hough_circle().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
