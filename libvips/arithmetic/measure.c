/* im_measure.c
 *
 * Modified: 
 * 19/8/94 JC
 *	- now uses doubles for addressing
 *	- could miss by up to h pixels previously!
 *	- ANSIfied
 *	- now issues warning if any deviations are greater than 20% of the
 *	  mean
 * 31/10/95 JC
 *	- more careful about warning for averages <0, or averages near zero
 *	- can get these cases with im_measure() of IM_TYPE_LAB images
 * 28/10/02 JC
 *	- number bands from zero in error messages
 * 7/7/04
 *	- works on labq
 * 18/8/08
 * 	- add gtkdoc comments
 * 	- remove deprecated im_extract()
 * 30/11/09
 * 	- changes for im_extract() broke averaging
 * 9/11/11
 * 	- redo as a class
