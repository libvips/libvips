/* im_lintra.c -- linear transform 
 *
 * Copyright: 1990, N. Dessipris, based on im_powtra()
 * Author: Nicos Dessipris
 * Written on: 02/05/1990
 * Modified on: 
 * 23/4/93 JC
 *	- adapted to work with partial images
 * 1/7/93 JC
 *	- adapted for partial v2
 * 7/10/94 JC
 *	- new IM_NEW()
 *	- more typedefs 
 * 9/2/95 JC
 *	- adapted for im_wrap...
 *	- operations on complex images now just transform the real channel
 * 29/9/95 JC
 *	- complex was broken
 * 15/4/97 JC
 *	- return(0) missing from generate, arrgh!
 * 1/7/98 JC
 *	- im_lintra_vec added
 * 3/8/02 JC
 *	- fall back to im_copy() for a == 1, b == 0
 * 10/10/02 JC
 *	- auug, failing to multiply imag for complex! (thanks matt)
 * 10/12/02 JC
 *	- removed im_copy() fallback ... meant that output format could change
 *	  with value :-( very confusing
 * 30/6/04
 *	- added 1 band image * n band vector case
 * 8/12/06
 * 	- add liboil support
 * 9/9/09
 * 	- gtkdoc comment, minor reformat
 * 31/7/10
 * 	- remove liboil
 * 31/10/11
 * 	- rework as a class
 * 	- removed the 1-ary constant path, no faster
