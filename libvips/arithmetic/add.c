 * Author: Nicos Dessipris
 * Written on: 02/05/1990
 * Modified on: 
 * 29/4/93 J.Cupitt
 *	- now works for partial images
 * 1/7/93 JC
 * 	- adapted for partial v2
 * 9/5/95 JC
 *	- simplified: now just handles 10 cases (instead of 50), using
 *	  im_clip2*() to help
 *	- now uses im_wrapmany() rather than im_generate()
 * 31/5/96 JC
 *	- SWAP() removed, *p++ removed
 * 27/9/04
 *	- im__cast_and_call() now matches bands as well
 *	- ... so 1 band + 4 band image -> 4 band image
 * 8/12/06
 * 	- add liboil support
 * 18/8/08
 * 	- revise upcasting system
 * 	- im__cast_and_call() no longer sets bbits for you
 * 	- add gtkdoc comments
 * 	- remove separate complex case, just double size
 * 11/9/09
 * 	- im__cast_and_call() becomes im__arith_binary()
 * 	- more of operation scaffold moved inside
 * 25/7/10
 * 	- remove oil support again ... we'll try Orc instead
 * 29/10/10
 * 	- move to VipsVector for Orc support
 * 28/2/11
 * 	- argh vector int/uint was broken
 * 4/4/11
 * 	- rewrite as a class

/**
 * vips_add:
 * @left: input image 
 * @right: input image 
 * @out: output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * This operation calculates @in1 + @in2 and writes the result to @out. 
 *
 * If the images differ in size, the smaller image is enlarged to match the
 * larger by adding zero pixels along the bottom and right.
 *
 * If the number of bands differs, one of the images 
 * must have one band. In this case, an n-band image is formed from the 
 * one-band image by joining n copies of the one-band image together, and then
 * the two n-band images are operated upon.
 *
 * The two input images are cast up to the smallest common type (see table 
 * Smallest common format in 
 * <link linkend="VIPS-arithmetic">arithmetic</link>), then the 
 * following table is used to determine the output type:
 *

 *
 * In other words, the output type is just large enough to hold the whole
 * range of possible values.
 *
 * Operations on integer images are performed using the processor's vector unit,
 * if possible. Disable this with --vips-novector or IM_NOVECTOR.
 *
 * See also: vips_subtract(), vips_linear().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
