 * im_make_xy:
 * @out: output image

 * Create a two-band uint32 image where the elements in the first band have the
 * value of their x coordinate and elements in the second band have their y
 * coordinate. 
 *
 * You can make any image where the value of a pixel is a function of its (x,
 * y) coordinate by combining this operator with the arithmetic operators. 
 *
 * See also: im_grey(), im_identity().

 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
