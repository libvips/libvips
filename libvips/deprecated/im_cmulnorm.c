/**
 * im_cmulnorm
 * @in1: input #IMAGE 1
 * @in2: input #IMAGE 2
 * @out: output #IMAGE
 *
 * im_cmulnorm() multiplies two complex images. The complex output is
 * normalised to 1 by dividing both the real and the imaginary part of each
 * pel with the norm. This is useful for phase correlation.  
 *
 * This operation used to be important, but now simply calls im_multiply() 
 * then im_sign().
 *
 * See also: im_multiply(), im_sign().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
