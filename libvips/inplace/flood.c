/* flood-fill
 *
 * JC 30/8/97
 *	- VIPSified, cleaned up, from "John Robinson's prog to fill 
 *	  enclosed areas"
 *	- something Kirk gave me, so thanks John 
 * JC 1/10/97
 *	- swapped inner memcmp/cpy for a loop ... faster for small pixels
 * 13/7/02 JC
 *	- im_flood_blob() added
 * 5/12/06
 * 	- im_invalidate() after paint
 * 24/3/09
 * 	- added IM_CODING_RAD support
 * 28/9/09
 * 	- ooops, tiny memleak
 * 17/12/09
 * 	- use inline rather than defines, so we can add scanline fills more
 * 	  easily
 * 	- gtk-doc comments
 * 21/12/09
 * 	- rewrite for a scanline based fill, about 4x faster!
 * 	- allow separate test and mark images
 * 22/1/10
 * 	- flood_blob could loop if start point == ink
 * 6/3/10
 * 	- don't im_invalidate() after paint, this now needs to be at a higher
 * 	  level
 * 27/9/10
 * 	- use Draw base class
