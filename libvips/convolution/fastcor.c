 *	- ANSIfied
 *	- in1 and in2 swapped, to match order for im_spcor
 *	- memory leaks fixed
 * 21/2/95 JC
 * 	- partialed
 *	- speed-ups
 * 7/4/04 
 *	- now uses im_embed() with edge stretching on the output
 *	- sets Xoffset / Yoffset
 * 8/3/06 JC
 *	- use im_embed() with edge stretching on the input, not the output
 *	- calculate sum of squares of differences, rather than abs of
 *	  difference
 * 3/2/10
 * 	- gtkdoc
 * 	- cleanups
 * 7/11/13
 * 	- redone as a class

/**
 * vips_fastcor: (method)
 * @in: input image
 * @ref: reference image
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Calculate a fast correlation surface.
 *
 * @ref is placed at every position in @in and the sum of squares of
 * differences calculated. 
 *
 * The output
 * image is the same size as the input. Extra input edge pixels are made by 
 * copying the existing edges outwards. 
 *
 * If the number of bands differs, one of the images 
 * must have one band. In this case, an n-band image is formed from the 
 * one-band image by joining n copies of the one-band image together, and then
 * the two n-band images are operated upon.
 *
 * The output type is uint if both inputs are integer, float if both are float
 * or complex, and double if either is double or double complex. 
 * In other words, the output type is just large enough to hold the whole
 * range of possible values.
 *
 * See also: vips_spcor().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
