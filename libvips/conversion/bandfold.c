 * * @factor: fold by this factor
 *
 * Fold up an image horizontally: width is collapsed into bands. 
 * Use @factor to set how much to fold by: @factor 3, for example, will make
 * the output image three times narrower than the input, and with three times
 * as many bands. By default the whole of the input width is folded up.
