/**
 * vips_grid: (method)
 * @in: input image
 * @out: (out): output image
 * @tile_height: chop into tiles this high
 * @across: tiles across
 * @down: tiles down
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Chop a tall thin image up into a set of tiles, lay the tiles out in a grid. 
 *
 * The input image should be a very tall, thin image containing a list of
 * smaller images. Volumetric or time-sequence images are often laid out like
 * this. This image is chopped into a series of tiles, each @tile_height
 * pixels high and the width of @in. The tiles are then rearranged into a grid
 * @across tiles across and @down tiles down in row-major order.
 *
 * Supplying @tile_height, @across and @down is not strictly necessary, we
 * only really need two of these. Requiring three is a double-check that the
 * image has the expected geometry. 
 *
 * See also: vips_embed(), vips_insert(), vips_join().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
