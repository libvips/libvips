/**
 * im_system_image:
 * @im: image to run command on
 * @in_format: write input file like this
 * @out_format: write output filename like this
 * @cmd_format: command to run
 * @log: stdout of command is returned here
 *
 * im_system_image() runs a command, passing an image in and getting an image
 * back. The command's stdout is returned in @log. 
 *
 * First, @im is written to a file. The filename is formed by substituting
 * something like "vips-49857-1" for the first %%s in @in_format, then
 * prepending "/tmp". If the environment variable TMPDIR is defined, it
 * can be used to set a different temporary directory. If @in_format is
 * something like "%%s.png", the file will be written in PNG format.
 *
 * On Windows, if the environment variable TMPDIR is not defined, VIPS calls 
 * GetTempPath() to get the user's preferred temporary area. If that fails, it
 * defaults to C:\temp.
 *
 * Next an output filename is created in the same way using @out_format. The
 * command string to run is made by substituting the first %%s in @cmd_format
 * for the name of the input file and the second %%s for the output filename.
 *
 * The command is executed with popen() and the output captured in @log. If
 * the command fails, the temporary files are deleted and im_system_image()
 * returns NULL. @log is still set.
 *
 * If the command succeeds, the input file is deleted, the output file opened,
 * and returned. Closing the output image will automatically delete the file.
 *
 * In all cases, @log must be freed with im_free().
 *
 * For example, this call will run the ImageMagick convert program on an
 * image, using JPEG files to pass images into and out of the convert command.
 *
 * |[
 * im_system_image( in, out, 
 *   "%s.jpg", "%s.jpg", "convert %s -swirl 45 %s", 
 *   &log )
 * ]|
 *
 * See also: im_system().
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): an image on success, NULL on error
