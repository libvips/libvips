libvips Code of Conduct
=======================

libvips, is developed and maintained by a mixed group of professionals and
volunteers from all over the world.

We ask people to adhere to a few ground rules. They apply equally to founders,
maintainers, contributors and those seeking help and guidance.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of things you are not allowed to do.
We rather would like you to think of it as a guide to enrich our community and
the technical community in general with new knowledge and perspectives by
allowing everyone to participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the libvips
community. This includes the mailing list, our GitHub projects, face to face
events, and any other forums created by the community for communication
within the community. In addition, violations of this code outside these
spaces may also affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
report it.

-   **Be friendly and patient.**
-   **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
    people of all backgrounds.
-   **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
    will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
    and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
    making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
    not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
-   **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
    is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience
    some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
    into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where
    people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of
    our community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
    well as with people outside the our community.
-   **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
    professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
    Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
    exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited
    to:
    -   Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    -   Discriminatory jokes and language.
    -   Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    -   Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
        information ("doxing").
    -   Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    -   Unwelcome sexual attention.
    -   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    -   Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
        then stop.
-   **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
    technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
    disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re
    different. The strength of group software development comes from its
    varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different
    people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand
    why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t
    forget we all make mistakes and blaming each other doesn’t get us
    anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning
    from mistakes.
