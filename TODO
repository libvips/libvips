- docs for im_guess_eprefix(), IM_EPREFIX

- merge loadable format stuff, postpone new object parameter API to next
  version

- note new VMask constructor in docs

  test new VMask constructor from python

- wrap meta() stuff in C++, we need it in py as well

  need fred.get_int ("poop"); I think

  add notes to docs on this

- try

	libsrc/convolution$ grep -l offsets *.c

  could we do the don't calc offsets thing unless bpl; changes thing in more
  places?

- docs include figures twice! yuk

  fixed? not sure, check again

- unsharp should work on GREY16? should be easy to add GREY16->LABS

  no, labs is signed short, ranges are all differrent, and the scaling will be
  wrong anyway

  correct: import with ICC to labs, then process, then export to RGB, take
  green?

  yuk, can we add a 16bit path to vips's lab <--> rgb converter?

  use TIFF RGB16 as the 16bit RGB target

  im_XYZ2disp() would be easy to 16bit ... just need the 1,500 element table
  table->t_Yr2r[i] expanded
  
  im_disp2XYZ() uses im_col_rgb2XYZ() in a loop ... again, need
  the 1,500 element table table->t_r2Yr[i] expanded

  usually these three tables (t_r2Yr, t_g2Yg, t_b2Yb) will be identical, can
  we common them up? same for t_Yr2r etc.

  how big should the table be for 16 bits? 256 times larger? too big!

  we really just need a LUT for pow() with the right exponent, eg. 2.4 for
  sRGBs, and one for 1/2.4 ... see what calcul_tables does:

  	table->t_r2Yr[i] = yo + a * pow( i * table->ristep / f + c, ga );

  see



  

- test maxpos_avg, quite a few changes

- HAVE_HYPOT could define a hypot() macro?

- im_exr2vips can now use c++ api

- python startup fails with plugins in vipslib:

	Fatal Python error: can't initialise module vips
	plugin: unable to open plugin "/home/john/vips/lib/resample.plg"
	plugin: /home/john/vips/lib/resample.plg: undefined symbol: im_start_one

  do we need to build plugins with -rpath etc. and more libs?

  or do we need to make sure our python modules export all their im_ symbols?

  check:

  	http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIGDocumentation.html#Python_nn8
	http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html

- write our own python extension to call a vips operation by name

	result = vips_call ("name", args)

  then call that from VImage_method

- do we really need VImage_method? Can't we write

	__getattr__ (self, name) = lambda (obj_to_call, arguments):

  or something like that?

- TIFF load/save should use meta system for unknown tags

- balance should use new meta stuff

- magick2vips should spot ICC profiles and attach them as meta

- also png2vips?

- magick should set some header field for n_frames and frame_height? see also
  analyze

- see TODO notes in openexr read (though they all need more openexr C API)

  consider openexr write

- im_csv2vips() could use "-" for filename to mean stdin

  but then we'd have to read to a malloced buffer of some sort rather than an
  image, since we might need to grow it during the read, since we couldn't
  then seek

- add erode/dilate 3x3 special case using a 512-bit LUT

  ... nope, actually slower :-( we end up doing an inner loop like

  	for( i = 0; i < 9; i++ )
		bits |= (p[o[i]] != 0) << i;

  which is horrible. Maybe if we had a one band true 1 bit image it'd be
  quicker since we could get bits out in parallel and wouldn't have to worry
  about converting non-zero to 1

  could have a Coding type for bitpack? eg. relational produces a bitpack
  image by default, boolean & morph can work on bitpack etc

  maybe something for vips8 ... we could have a flag on operations for the
  coding types they can accept, and if they are passed other type, they are
  automatically converted

- non-linear sharpen: replace each pixel by the lightest or darkest neighbour
  depending on which is closer in value

- can wrap other inplace funcs which use ink now we have vector_to_ink() in
  inplace_dispatch.c

  see also comments in nip2 TODO ... we could auto-wrap in vips_call.c

  cleaner!

- on win32, should not write matrix files in binary mode, we want CR/LF chars
  so we can load into excel etc easily

  how odd, we're doing

	if( !(fp = fopen( name, "w" )) ) {

  shouldn't be binary ... hmm
